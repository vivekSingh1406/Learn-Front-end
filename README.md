Phase 1: Web Fundamentals
Before diving into Angular, ensure you’re solid on:
- HTML & CSS: Semantic markup, Flexbox/Grid, responsive design
- JavaScript (ES6+): Arrow functions, promises, async/await, modules
- TypeScript: Angular is built with TypeScript, so learn types, interfaces, generics, and decorators

Phase 2: Angular Core Concepts
Start building Angular apps with these essentials:
- Angular CLI: Project setup, scaffolding components/services
- Modules & Components: Structure, lifecycle hooks, templates
- Data Binding: Property, event, and two-way binding
- Directives & Pipes: Built-in and custom
- Routing: Navigation, route guards, lazy loading
- Services & Dependency Injection: Singleton services, DI patterns
- Forms: Template-driven vs reactive forms
- HTTP Client: API calls, observables, error handling

Phase 3: Advanced Angular
Deepen your expertise with:
- State Management: RxJS, NgRx, Signals (new in Angular 17+)
- Change Detection: Zones, OnPush strategy
- Performance Optimization: Lazy loading, preloading, hydration
- Testing: Unit tests (Jasmine/Karma), end-to-end (Protractor/Cypress)
- Accessibility (a11y): ARIA roles, keyboard navigation
- Internationalization (i18n): Localization strategies

Phase 4: Angular Ecosystem & Tooling
Master the tools that support Angular development:
- Linting & Formatting: ESLint, Prettier
- Build Tools: Webpack, Vite (experimental)
- Monorepos: Nx for scalable enterprise apps
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- Design Systems: Angular Material, Tailwind CSS

Phase 5: Real Projects & Portfolio
Apply your skills:
- Build 3–5 real-world apps (e.g., task manager, e-commerce, dashboard)
- Contribute to open-source Angular projects
- Create a GitHub portfolio with clean code and documentation
